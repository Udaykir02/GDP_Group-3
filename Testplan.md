### Introduction

This test plan outlines the strategy for testing an Ecommerce App developed with React Native, serving both Android and iOS platforms. With a focus on vendor, user, and product management functionalities, our testing ensures reliability and user-friendliness, omitting third-party integrations. By meticulously planning tests, we aim to ensure the app's functionality, performance, and usability across diverse scenarios, delivering a robust user experience.

**Purpose of the Document:** 

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the testing team to validate the core functionalities and features of the Ecommerce App, guaranteeing its reliability, security, and user-friendliness.â€¯

**Summary of Goals:**

**The primary goals of this test plan include:**

- Verification of authentication mechanisms for user registration and login processes, including testing API endpoints for secure user authentication.
- Validation of password recovery functionality to ensure seamless user access, including thorough testing of relevant API endpoints.
- Testing product listing functionality to ensure accurate display and categorization, with a focus on validating API endpoints for fetching and displaying product information.
- Evaluation of vendor management features, including product upload and inventory management, with comprehensive testing of corresponding API endpoints.

**Constraints:**

Restricted resources could influence the depth and breadth of testing, leading to a concentration on prioritizing essential features for comprehensive scrutiny.

#### Not to be tested
 
 
| Feature description | List of functional requirements | Rationale |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| Maps API | FR 12 | Testing for the Google Maps API isn't typically necessary due to its robustness and widespread usage, backed by rigorous internal testing by Google. |
| Stripe Payments API | FR 16 | Testing for the Stripe Payments API is typically not required because Stripe provides a robust suite of pre-configured testing tools and environments, such as their sandbox mode, which allows developers to simulate transactions without affecting live data
| Algolia Search API | FR 20 | Testing for the Algolia Search API may not be necessary because Algolia provides its own robust testing infrastructure, ensuring reliability and accuracy of search results. Additionally, given Algolia's extensive documentation and straightforward integration process, developers can confidently rely on the API without the need for extensive manual testing |
