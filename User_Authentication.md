Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a client. When access control is enabled, MongoDB requires all clients to authenticate themselves in order to determine their access.

Although authentication and authorization are closely connected, authentication is distinct from authorization:

Authentication verifies the identity of a user.

Authorization determines the verified user's access to resources and operations.
