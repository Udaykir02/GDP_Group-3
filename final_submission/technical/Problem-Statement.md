# Problem Statement: Advancing E-commerce Mobile Experience

Significant changes in customer behavior and company dynamics have resulted from the revolution of the retail landscape brought about by the rise of online e-commerce shopping. Although it has given customers convenience and a multitude of options, its quick expansion has also brought up certain difficulties, particularly for small and local sellers.

A notable consequence of the e-commerce boom is the emergence of monopolistic market structures, wherein major businesses like Amazon, Alibaba, and others have a dominant position. These industry titans have built complete web platforms that serve as a one-stop shop for customers by using their enormous resources and cutting-edge technologies. Through collaboration with distributors and effective supply chain management, they may offer a wide selection of goods at affordable costs.

Their market domination is further reinforced by their utilization of cutting-edge data science methodologies and powerful software technologies. With the help of these technologies, they may develop applications that are easy to use and accessible on a variety of devices, resulting in a flawless shopping experience. Data science also aids in the prediction of product prices and demand trends, which enables these businesses to improve their pricing and inventory plans.

Unfortunately, local merchants have suffered as a result of the success of these large tech companies. The technology infrastructure and financial resources required for many small enterprises to compete on an equal footing are lacking. Consequently, they frequently have challenges in maintaining profitability and adjusting to the digital age.

Furthermore, the dominance of these big platforms can result in a concentration of economic power, which would reduce the variety of items accessible on the market and restrict customer choice. By inhibiting competition and innovation, this monopolistic trend may also have a negative impact on the state of the economy as a whole.
