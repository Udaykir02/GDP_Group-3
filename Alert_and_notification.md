For the requirements on alerts and notifications in an e-commerce setting, we typically need a robust system that can handle real-time monitoring and trigger actions based on certain conditions. Here's how you can achieve the mentioned alerts and notifications:

Automated Alerts for Low Stock Levels and Order Status Updates:

**Low Stock Levels**: Set up a monitoring system that regularly checks the stock levels of your products. When stock levels fall below a certain threshold, trigger an automated alert to notify the relevant personnel. This can be done using a combination of database queries and scheduled scripts.

**Order Status Updates**: Implement a system that updates order statuses in real-time as they progress through different stages (e.g., order received, payment processed, order shipped). Depending on the status, trigger automated notifications to customers (e.g., order confirmation, shipping confirmation) 
and internal staff (e.g., fulfillment team, customer service).

Notifications for Users Based on Predefined Triggers:

Define specific triggers that warrant notifications to users. These triggers could include actions such as:
**Abandoned carts**: Send a reminder to users who have items in their cart but haven't completed the checkout process after a certain period.
